# Design a database

Construct a schema that solves the following problem.

> Design a schema for a web shop. The shop has an inventory of products, each item has a price but depending on sales this price can vary.
> Customers can make an order for multiple items at a time and want to be able to see their order history as it was at the time of ordering.
> When the order has been completed an optional track and trace number can be attached to the package.

Make it simple to work with while also keeping performance in mind.

# Solution

Use a UML tool of your choice.
It's very important that you include table cardinality.

## What you'll be evaluated on
You must deliver a PNG image of your solution. Failing to do so, i.e. delivery in a format of the modeling tool that you choose will result in 0 points. 
We expect your schema to be in UML format not E/R etc. 
You'll be evaluated on your ability to correctly design a schema that solves the problem.
